# Modern UI Autopipeline

This queue is used for autonomous modernization runs while keeping legacy behavior available as fallback.

## Completed

1. Dashboard and candidate list/show modern pages.
2. Candidate profile enrichment: EEO, events, questionnaires.
3. Candidate add/edit route bridge in modern shell (legacy-safe iframe).
4. Full-width shell fix for `ui2-sidebar-enabled`.
5. Candidate navigation links forced to `ui=modern` across dashboard and candidates pages.
6. Shared modern URL utility applied across dashboard/candidate links.
7. Expanded sample route map to run major modules inside modern shell compatibility mode.
8. Native `candidates.edit` phase 1: modern form UI + legacy-safe save endpoint.
9. Native `candidates.add` phase 1: modern form UI + legacy-safe create endpoint.
10. Native `joborders.listByView` phase 1: modern filters/table UI + modern-json backend contract.
11. Native `joborders.listByView` phase 2: sort controls + monitored toggle action wiring.
12. Native `joborders.show` phase 1: modern profile UI + modern-json backend contract (summary, pipeline, attachments, hiring plan).
13. Native `joborders.listByView` phase 3: column visibility controls for dense recruiter workflows.
14. Native `candidates.add/edit` phase 2: dynamic extra fields + modern attachment actions wired to legacy-safe endpoints.
15. Native `joborders.show` phase 2: comments/messages native panels + richer quick actions + attachment action wiring.
16. Native `joborders.listByView` phase 4: column presets with per-user persistence (local storage keyed by site/user).
17. Native duplicate pre-check flow in `candidates.add` with modern inline review (hard/soft match UX).
18. Native in-app status change modal on `dashboard.my` (popup replaced by embedded modal workflow).
19. Expanded embedded modal coverage for pipeline actions (`dashboard.my` details, `candidates.show` pipeline actions, `joborders.show` pipeline actions).
20. Candidate action parity: modern Add-To-List overlay + embedded Add-To-Job modal flows on list/show pages.
21. Native dashboard drag/drop status mutation: no-popup transition endpoint with CSRF, owner-scope guardrails, forward-only enforcement, auto-fill for skipped stages, and hired openings checks.
22. Dashboard assign workspace (`considerCandidateSearch`) moved from popup to embedded modal flow in modern UI shell.
23. Removed `Open In Popup` affordance from shared embedded legacy modal component to reduce popup dependency across modern pages.
24. Added modern-json pipeline removal mutation path (with CSRF tokens) and wired inline remove actions on `candidates.show` and `joborders.show` to use it with confirm + note prompts.

## Next Queue

1. Replace iframe-backed legacy modal flows with native React forms/interactions for pipeline status change/details editing (remove path is now native-json).

## Rules

1. Keep legacy route available for every migrated page (`Open Legacy UI` action present).
2. Use small, verifiable commits per slice.
3. Run `npm run build` for `frontend/modern-ui` before bundle commits.
4. Commit source and bundle artifacts separately.
